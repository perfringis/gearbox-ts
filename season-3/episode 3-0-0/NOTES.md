The Dreyfus and Dreyfus learning model, also known as the five stages of competence model, was developed by brothers Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus in the 1970s. This model describes how learners acquire skills and knowledge in a given field by progressing through five sequential stages. It is widely used in various contexts, including education, vocational training, and skill development.

# The Five Stages of the Dreyfus Model

## Novice:

Characteristics: At this stage, the individual has minimal knowledge of the field. They learn by strictly following rules and instructions without a deeper understanding of the context.

Learning: Focuses on basic principles and simple tasks. Learning involves memorizing and applying simple rules.

## Advanced Beginner:

Characteristics: The individual starts to recognize patterns and notices more complex aspects of the task but still primarily adheres to rules.

Learning: Begins to integrate basic principles with practice but still lacks a full understanding of the overall context.

## Competent:

Characteristics: The individual begins to make decisions independently and plan their actions. They understand goals and can handle unforeseen situations.

Learning: Learns through experience and practice, starting to see broader patterns and strategies.

## Proficient:

Characteristics: The individual has a deep understanding of the field, can intuitively recognize patterns, and respond to them.

Learning: Acts more intuitively, making decisions based on experience and an understanding of the overall context. Analyzes and evaluates different approaches to problems.

## Expert:

Characteristics: The individual reaches the highest level of skill, acting smoothly and intuitively. They can handle complex and unpredictable situations without needing to refer to rules.

Learning: Learns through reflection on their own experience and continuous improvement. Can create new rules and strategies in response to new challenges.
