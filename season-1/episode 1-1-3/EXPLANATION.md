# Cognitive Overload

A trainee joins a new project. He expects microservices, meaning few classes, nicely divided modules. Logic encapsulated in small classes and methods. Of course, microservices in Kotlin.

# Collision with Reality
The trainee collides with reality from the first code analysis. In a real project, it would be classic code with eight thousand lines.

# Project Structure
It is what it is. We can't blame the current state on the trainee, who is encountering this code for the first time.

# Procedural Nature of the Code
The code is strictly procedural, with operations carried out step by step. There's no clear hierarchy of logic and control emerging from the code. It's known that the M-dynamic mode affects all previous modes.

# The Squat Principle

The squat principle didn't work here. Leave the campsite in a better state than you found it.

# Showing Initiative
The trainee showed initiative. He asked if he could write tests.

# Stress
In stress, there's no room for exposing creativity. The boss ordered the task to be completed in 20 minutes.

# Requirements
Clarifying the requirements will allow us to understand something we don't know yet.
