You haven't started working on that new feature with the aggressiveness of the gearbox. Do you know why? Because I talked to a friend who happens to work in the automotive industry, and he said it works a bit differently. What I’ve told you so far should remain the same. Nothing changes. It should work exactly as I’ve described. But you know, I explained it more from a user’s perspective: that I press the gas or brake and the gearbox reacts to the pressing of those pedals in the car. This perspective still holds from a user’s point of view, but let's approach it from a completely different angle. Namely, our gearbox should react to the engine’s RPMs. Look at it this way: I take my foot off the gas, and we roll slowly, right? And the gears change automatically. Right now, we're in sport mode. When you switch to comfort mode, we're rolling, driving slower and slower, and the gears change on their own without my intervention on the pedals. So, modify the code a bit so that it actually reacts to the signals from the engine’s RPMs. This is the main trigger, and then how deep the gas or brake pedal is pressed and whether it affects a single or double kick-down will be calculated later. For now, the main logic will be based on what’s happening in the engine. I hope this doesn’t change much for you. It’s a cosmetic change in reworking the if statements, so good luck. Bye for now.
