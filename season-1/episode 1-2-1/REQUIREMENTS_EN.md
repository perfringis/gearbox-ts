Kuba, there has been a small change. You know what? The client wants to add a trailer towing mode. Of course, these toys won’t have a real trailer because the business plan has changed a bit and we will also be making a virtual reality simulator. For learning how to drive a car, so I would like you to add a function where if a trailer is hitched to the back (we detect this) and at that moment, engine braking is required, meaning I don’t brake with my foot but when I release the gas pedal. The gearbox should ensure that the gear is set so that the engine RPM is such that the car starts to slow down on its own. This is to avoid straining the brakes when we have a 2-ton trailer behind us. So you will need to make some extensions here. Because, you know, how will we know if we are driving uphill or downhill? It turns out that there is a problem with accessing such information in the equipment we have, but it can be extracted from the lights. If you have headlight washers, there is information that tells you whether we are going uphill or downhill, so you will connect to these lights to know the angle of inclination, and if we are going downhill and have a trailer behind us, you know, engine braking is necessary. So I think you guys can handle it. Bye for now.
