Kuba, we need to quickly add an additional feature. Can you manage to put it on the demo before I get to the client? Look! It turned out we're adding a new mode. There's this mode, umm, dynamic (m-dynamic mode). Now something happened. At the back, we have an electronically controlled variable slip differential. There are these clutches, which while you're in a slide, determine the slip level of the left and right side so you can stay in the drift as long as possible. So listen. The client came up with the idea that in such a mode, when you're in a slide, which you will probably be able to detect based on some angular velocities and so on. So, when you're in a slide, the gearbox shouldn't interfere in any way with changing the gear (neither up nor down). Simply so he could calmly. Oh, see how now, right. We're doing something like this. Bam. Slide, and it has no right to change the gear on me. Clear? Simple! Get to work. Bye for now.
