Okay Kuba. The last iteration ended with great success. That's exactly what it was all about. Now the client would like to add something new. Look, in our gearbox we can change modes. We can drive in economy mode, which is focused on consuming as little fuel as possible. In our simulator, it will only mean that the point at which the gears change will be different, meaning the gearbox will shift to the next gears at already low revs. With a button, we will be able to switch modes: sport, sport plus. Look at what happens. In sport mode, we add gas. The gearbox allows the engine to reach higher revs. In sport plus mode, it goes even higher and stays there even longer. And in economy mode, something happens where as soon as you add a little gas, it already shifts to the next gear. This is quite simple, I think. And now we've received a table from the client in Excel, which will detail. In which mode at what revs the gear should be changed, or in other words. What range of engine revs is allowed in a given mode for a given gear.
