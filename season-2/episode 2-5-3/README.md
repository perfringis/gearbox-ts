# Combinatorial Explosion

SÅ‚awek provides an interesting example. Let's assume we have a Client class and two subclasses that inherit from the Client class. ClientVip and ClientGold can be used, and we can take on both roles. Of course, they can. An Enum is not suitable for implementing roles when a system can play multiple roles.

# Architectural Driver

If we know that we need to write something quickly and this code will soon be discarded, then it's okay!
