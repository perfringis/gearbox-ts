Kuba, now it's time to test your agility because, besides the fact that this gearbox automatically shifts gears, the customer requested to add paddle shifters like these here. I can personally demonstrate. I'm currently in sixth gear. I downshift to fifth. I downshift to fourth. It changes itself after some time. After some time, the gearbox will start shifting gears back again, but look what happens when you switch to manual mode. Then it doesn't interfere at all. So if I downshift to fourth, I'll stay in fourth. Clear? Check if this works in one specific case. Namely, engine braking. So now I'm approaching the lights. For example, if it's very slippery, I don't want to brake with the pedal, I just downshift the gears. See? This is to make the gearbox force high engine revs and to brake with the engine, not with the brake pedal. So include this in your tests as well. Bye for now.
