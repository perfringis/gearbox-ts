Kuba, we're adding a new feature. There is a mechanism called kickdown, so imagine we're driving behind a truck. We want to overtake and we press the gas pedal, and the transmission should understand this, just like you saw now, that it should downshift. Based on how deeply I press the gas pedal. It knows that now I'm getting ready to overtake and it downshifts for me. Just remember, in sport and sport plus mode, the transmission immediately downshifts two gears. Unless we're already in low gear, right? Unless we're already in a low gear and we reach high RPMs. It needs to detect this with a simple if statement, but the general idea is as I said. Look! A strong kick and we accelerate. Well, that's all for now.
