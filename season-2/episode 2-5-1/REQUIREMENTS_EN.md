Kuba, one last feature. In this milestone. Specifically, look here. There will be a little switch, which will influence, let's say, the aggressiveness of the gearbox's operation. Right now we are at its second level of aggressiveness. If we switch it to the first level, the gearbox will change gears smoothly. We won't feel any jerking, and it will happen quite slowly. Just like now. Look! We are driving calmly, but in the second mode, it will happen faster. The gearbox will allow for higher revs and the table in Excel that I gave you shows the relationship between gear changes and the mode we're in. That's one thing, but each of these values changes by about 30% if we are in the second mode of aggressiveness for our gearbox. Okay? Then there's the third mode. The third mode works the same as the second mode. That is, we also change at higher revs and those revs are maintained longer. The gearbox operates faster, jerks. Additionally, during downshifts, there are pops from the exhaust. In this car, it works in such a way that the mixture injected into the engine is composed a bit differently, leaving some unburnt fuel. It gets heated but not completely burnt. It exits the car and reacts with oxygen, causing a small explosion. So there should be these audible pops in our sound module and during downshifts like now. There should be these jerks. Okay? So, it's a simple topic. If it turns out that you have any technical issues, create a separate microservice to handle these buttons. This will be something independent. Have fun with it, it'll be nice. So, see you later.
