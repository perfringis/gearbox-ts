These Saturday overtime hours always give me a lot to think about. I don't understand this kick-down function. So I press the gas. I do a kick-down. Which means I kick, right? And nothing happens. Nothing happens at all. There's no double downshift. Maybe I need to change the modes? Here? Oh! Sport. Oh! It worked! I didn't know before because my father never allowed me to switch to this mode.
